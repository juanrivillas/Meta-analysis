# Meta-analysis

This repository contains R code for conducting a meta-analysis investigating the relationship between low parental socioeconomic position (SEP) and offspring's inflammation and cardiometabolic outcomes in later life. The meta-analysis covers 1) Cardiovascular function, 2) Glucose metabolism, 3) Lipid metabolism, 4) Adiposity, and 5) Inflammation.

This script to calculate power for a random-effects meta-analysis based on https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/1076998609346961 
This reporsitory is organised as follows:

-Data Processing: Scripts for data cleaning, formatting, and harmonization across studies included in the meta-analysis.
-Effect Size Calculation: Code to calculate relevant effect sizes (e.g., standardized mean differences SMD) for the association between parental SEP and each biomarker.
-Heterogeneity Analysis: Scripts to assess heterogeneity between studies and explore potential sources of variation.
-Publication Bias Assessment: Code to evaluate potential publication bias using methods like funnel plots and Egger's test.
-Meta-Regression Analysis: Notebooks for exploring how study characteristics (e.g., sample size, publication year) might moderate the observed relationships.
-Visualization: Scripts to generate informative visualizations of the meta-analysis results (forest plots, subgroup analyses).
